Jaipur Trip

Day 1:
Lots of forts to see. See the Amer Fort, Nahargarh Fort and the Hawa Mahal for its breezy architecture. Don't forget the
Jal Mahal and the City Palace either.

Day 2:
Taking a break from forts, go to the Birla Mandir. See the World Trade Park and pay a token visit to Jaipur Zoo.

Day 3:
Back to some forts. Jaigarh fort and the Kanak Vrindavan Mahal. Albert Hall Museum can provide a welcome break from
the mundanity of daily lives.
